### Step 1: Obtain Your API Key

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2. Generate a new API key under the **API Key** section.

Your API key will look something like this: `AIzaSyDzgOdLlyl0peuWb-JGGiu2mvDhSbm0NwQ`

> **Note**: A temporary **Fire Key** is provided for you to use, but if it stops working, it has likely reached its usage limit. The API is free but has a limited number of requests.

### Step 2: Insert the API Key

1. Open your project in VS Code (or your preferred text editor).
2. Navigate to the `script.js` file.
3. Replace the placeholder in the `API_KEY` variable with your actual API key.

```javascript
// script.js
const API_KEY = 'PASTE-YOUR-API-KEY';  // Replace with your API key
```

### Step 3: Run the Project

1. Save the `script.js` file after you enter the API key.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to ensure Gemini is working properly.
